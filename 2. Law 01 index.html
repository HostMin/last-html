<h2>Law 01</h2>
<h3>The field of play</h3>
<strong><u>1. Field surface</u></strong>
<br>The entire surface of the stadium shall be natural grass, or the entire surface shall be artificial grass, if permitted by the competition regulations. However, this shall not apply where artificial and natural mixed grass (hybrid system) is allowed in the competition regulations. 
<p>The color of the artificial grass must be green.</p>
<p>When competitions between association teams affiliated with FIFA or international club competitions are held on artificial turf, the surface must meet FIFA's grass quality standards. However, exceptions are made when special guidelines from the IFAB are received.</p>
<br><strong><u>2. Field markings</u></strong>
<br>The stadium must be rectangular and marked so that successive lines are not dangerous. Artificial turf surface materials can be used to mark fields on natural turf, if not hazardous. Boundaries are included in the area of each area.
<p>Only the lines specified in Section 1 of the Regulation shall be marked on the field. If artificial grass is used, it is used if other lines are of a different color or are clearly distinguished from those used in football.</p>
<p>Two long boundaries are called touchlines. The two short boundaries are called goal lines.</p><p>The stadium is divided into two by the half-way line where the center points of both touchlines meet.</p><p>The center mark is marked at the center point of the half-way line. The center circle is marked by a circle with a radius of 9.15 m (10 yds).</p>

<br><strong><u>3. Dimension</u></strong>
<br> The touchline must be longer than the goal line
<p><li>Length(touchline): minimum 90m(100yds) / maximum 120m(130yds)
</li><li>Length(goal line): minimum 45m(50yds) / maximum 90m(100yds)</li></P>
<br>Competitions may determine the length of the goal line and touchline with the above dimensions.
<p><br><strong><u>4.Dimensions for international matches</u></strong>
<p><li>Length(touchline): minimum 100m(110yds) / maximum 110m(120yds)
</li><li>Length(touchline): minimum 64m(70yds) / maximum 75m(80yds)</li></P>
<br>Competitions may determine the length of the goal line and touchline with the above dimensions.</P>

<br><strong><u>5. The goal area</u></strong>
<br>Draw two 5.5 m (6 yds) long lines inside the stadium at right angles to the goal line at 5.5 m (6 yds) from the inside of each goal post and connect the ends in a straight line parallel to the goal line. The area surrounded by these lines and goal lines is the goal area.
<br><strong><u>6. The penalty area</u></strong>
<br>At 16.5 m (18 yards) from the inside of each goal post, draw two 16.5 m (18 yds) long lines inward at right angles to the goal line, and connect the ends in a straight line parallel to the goal line. The area surrounded by these lines and goal lines is the penalty area.
<p>The penalty mark shall be marked at a point 11 m from the center point between the two goal posts within each penalty area.</p><p>The penalty arc shall be marked by drawing an arc outside the penalty area with a radius of 9.15 m (10 yds) from the center of each penalty mark.</p>
<br><strong><u>7. The corner area</u></strong>
<br>The corner area displays a quarter circle with a radius of 1 m (1 yrd) drawn inside the field at each corner flag post.

<br><strong><u>8. Flagposts</u></strong>
<br>Flag posts must be installed at each corner, with a flagpole and a flag with a minimum height of not less than 1.5 m (5 feet).
<p>Flag posts may also be installed at a point of at least 1 m (1 yd) outside the touch line at both ends of the half-way line.</p>

<br><strong><u>9. The technical area</u></strong>
<br>The technical area is the area designated for the competition to be seated by the team officers, replacements and the replacements involved in the competition in the description below:
<li>The technical area extends 1 m (1 yrd) from each side of the installed seating area and extends forward to a distance of 1 m (1 yrd) from the touchline.</li>
<li>Marks are made to clearly distinguish technical areas.</li>
<li>The number of persons who may be in the technical area is specified in the competition regulations.</li>
<li>theoccupants of the technical area:
    <ol>
    <li>are identified before the start of the match in accordance with the competition rules</li>

</li>
<li>only one person at a time is authorised to convey tactical instructions from the technical area</li>

<br><strong><u>10. Goals</u></strong>
<br>A goal must be placed on the centre of each goal line.
<br>Two posts are vertically placed at the same distance from both corner flag posts, and the top of the two posts are connected by a horizontal crossbar. The goalpost and crossbar must be of the same shape and must be square, rectangular, circular or oval, or a combination of these shapes.
<p>The goalposts used in official competitions organized by FIFA or the Continental Federation must conform to FIFA quality program standards related to the goalposts.</p>
<p>The distance inside the post is 7.32 m (8 yrds) and the height from the ground to the bottom of the crossbar is 2.44 m (8 ft).</p><p>The position of the goalposts in relation to the goal line must be in accordance with the graphics.</p>

The game resumes with a drop ball. If it is impossible to repair the crossbar, you should give up the game. The use of ropes, flexible objects, or dangerous materials to replace the Grossbar is not permitted.</p><p>The goal net may be installed on the post and on the ground behind the post, but it should be fully supported and not obstructed by the goalkeeper.</p>
