<h3>Philosophy and spirit of the rules of competition</h3>
<img src="together.jpg" width="300">
<p style="margin-top: 18px;"> <br><strong>Soccer</strong>is a best sport in the world. People of all ages are enjoying soccer in many countries around the world.
From the FIFA World Cup finals to the soccer of children in remote villages, the fact is that it is being played under the same rules everywhere. It's about sharing the good of football with everyone.It's an important element that's needed, and it's an advantage that needs to be kept in the future.
 <br>The basis of <u>beautiful soccer</u>is fairness. The rules of the game contain fairness, which is a key element of the soccer spirit, so it will be excluded from soccer.
 I can't. The most spectacular game is when players respect other players, referees, and rules of play, requiring little refereeing.</p> 
<p>
<br>The rules of soccer are relatively simple compared to other team sports. Nevertheless, in many situations, 'subjective' judgments are required. Judges are human, so some decisions are inevitable.
Inevitably, it may be wrong, and it may cause controversy or debate. For some, these debates are part of the fun and charm of football. 
But regardless of whether a decision is right or wrong, the 'spirit' of football requires that the referee's decision be always respected. Especially, leaders and team captains.
Everyone has a clear duty to respect the judges and their decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 25px;">
    If there is no direct provision in the rules of the competition because the rules of the competition cannot cover all situations, <a href="https://www.theifab.com" target="_blank" title="The offical IFAB site">IFAB</a>expects referees to make decisions based on the 'spirit' of football. for this reason often
    You ask the question, "What does soccer want and what do you expect?"
<br>Rules of competition should also be helpful for the safety and safety of athletes. Providing reasonable assistance to those who participate in soccer through the rules of the game at the request of those who participate in soccer.
In addition, it would be the responsibility of the <a href="https://www.theifab.com" target="_blank" title="The offical IFAB site">IFAB</a>to respond quickly to the request. For example, the spread of COVID-19 is a problem. 
As a countermeasure, a provisional amendment to Article 3 of the Rules of the Competition has been introduced to allow each team to increase the maximum number of substitutes from three to five. The provisional amendment is now formally incorporated into Rules 2022/23. 
In addition, the trial run of "Chicken Replacement" will continue. Leaders can show signs of concussion without worrying about numerical disadvantages, or replace players suspected of concussion, so player safety is now a priority.
